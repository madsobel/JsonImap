# JsonImap
 
This is the start of a wrapper to the [PHP IMAP library](http://php.net/manual/en/book.imap.php). **Please note** that this is the very beginning of something awesome.

## Usage so far
In order to use JsonImap, you have to initialize the class with three parameters:

1. Servername e.g.: `{imap.gmail.com:993/ssl}`
2. Username e.g.: `foo@bar.com`
3. Password e.g.: `changeme`

## Roadmap
* Cover all major functions of the PHP library
* Implement [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer) for sending out an email
* Composer
* Tests
* REST API
* Demo App written around the REST API
